def multiply(x, y):
    """
    Multiply two values and return the result.

    Parameters:
        x (int or float): The first number.
        y (int or float): The second number.

    Returns:
        int or float: The product of `x` and `y`.

    Note:
        Although Python allows multiplication of a number and a string (resulting in string repetition),
        this function is intended only for numeric multiplication. Passing a string as an argument
        is not supported and may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

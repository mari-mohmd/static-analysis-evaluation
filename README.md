# Static Analysis Evaluation Code

This repository contains supplemental code for the research study:

**"Type Safety in Python: Existing Frameworks, Challenges, and Future Directions"**

submitted to the *Software Impacts* journal.

## About

The code in this repository includes small Python snippets used to evaluate the behavior and effectiveness of various **static analysis tools** in detecting type-related issues in Python code.

The goal is to explore how well existing tools support type safety in Python, highlight their limitations, and identify areas for improvement or further research.

## Contents

- A collection of Python files demonstrating type safety issues
- This README file
